# Supplementary Material For the Paper "NUTS, NARS, and Speech"

To investigate whether “Intelligence is the capacity of an information-processing system to adapt to its environment while operating with 
insufficient knowledge and resources", we look at utilising the non axiomatic reasoning system (NARS) for speech recognition. This article presents NUTS: raNdom dimensionality redUction non axiomaTic reasoning few Shot learner for perception. NUTS consists of naive dimensionaility reduction, some pre-processing, and then non axiomatic reasoning (NARS). 
With only 2 training examples per class, NUTS achieves 64% accuracy, with 20 examples per class we achieve 90% accuracy, on the 35 word standard command dataset.

With 2 Examples per class, we achive 64% accuracy, at 20 examples per class we achieve 90% accuracy (embedding space dimensions = 5).

This is achieved with a low dimensional embedding space (5 dimensions), which reduces compute (examples per class = 4).

# Reproduction

## 1 Clone NUTS

cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/dwanev/NUTS 

## 2 Install ONA (Open NARS for applications)

 - NUTS uses open NARS for applications (ONA). Which  can be found here: https://github.com/opennars/OpenNARS-for-Applications. ONA is installations instructions can be found on the webpage above, but in brief:

cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/opennars/OpenNARS-for-Applications  
cd OpenNARS-for-Applications  
./build.sh  

 - Set up an environment variable so the NUTS can find ONE

export ONA_PATH_TO_NAR=~/projects/OpenNARS-for-Applications 


## 3 Create a virtual environment 

conda create -n nuts python=3.9
conda activate nuts

## 4 Install dependencies 

cd ~/projects/NUTS
conda activate nuts  
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 5 Reproduce experiments 

python3 main_confusion_matrix_performance.py  
python3 main_experiment_vary_AIKR_limit.py  
python3 main_experiment_vary_dimensions.py  
python3 main_experiment_vary_examples_per_class.py 



# Misc

### To start NARs (Just FYI)

cd projects/OpenNARS-for-Applications  
conda activate open_nars  
./NAR shell
